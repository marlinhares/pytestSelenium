# pytestSeleniumDocker

This is a simple conteiner with python selenium and pytest.
I made this to run automated web tests.

You can build the tests using:
- Selenium IDE (web interface)
- export selenium IDE to python code
- run this conteiner with the tests

In my case Jenkins runs all the pipeline(build environment from zero, apply changes, and run the tests using this conteiner).
