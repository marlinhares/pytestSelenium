# pytestSelenium

This is a simple conteiner with python pipenv selenium and pytest.
I made this to run automated web tests.

You can build the tests using:
- Selenium IDE (web interface)
- export selenium IDE to python code
- run the conteiner with the tests

In my case Jenkins runs all the pipeline, build environment from zero, apply changes, and run the tests using this conteiner.
